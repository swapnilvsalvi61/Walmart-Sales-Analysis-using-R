I am using three techniques hypothesis testing, lasso regression and clustering to analyzing the sales with various other fields as a predictor. In the first section we have cleaned the data to remove all the anomalies, second is the analysis part in which we have analyzed the data and performed several techniques using R. The last section is the result of the all techniques which we have used. Several business question can be answered for the future scope of this analysis.
